The key idea behind ensemble learning is that by aggregating the predictions from several models, the strengths of individual models can be leveraged, and their weaknesses can be mitigated, thus improving the overall performance of modeling."

    "The idea of **bagging**, short for **Bootstrap Aggregating**, is to train multiple models independently on different bootstrapped subsets of the training data, and then the predictions are averaged (for regressors) or voted upon (for classifiers). Bootstrapping is a statistical technique that generates multiple samples from a single (small) dataset by sampling with replacement so that estimates of the distribution of a statistic, e.g., the mean, variance, or confidence interval, can be made when the underlying distribution of the data is unknown. The following diagram illustrates how boostrapping works."

    "Bagging is particularly effective for reducing variance and preventing overfitting, especially in models with high variability such as decision trees. A high-variability model highly depends on the training dataset. If a different training set is used, then the model can behave quite differently. With bootstrapping, we are creating a group of approximately independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) training sets, and an individual model (with high variance) is trained on each of the sets. By combining the models and averaging the predictions, the ensemble is likely less variable than any of its component learners.\n",

Suppose $M$ samples each of size $N$ are obtained by bootstrapping. For each bootstrapped samples $S_1, S_2,\\dots, S_M$, we fit a model $f_i(x), i=1,\\dots,M$.

    "In the bagging algorithm above, we assume the sampling is done with replacement. In the case of no replacement, the method is called **pasting**. In some cases, we may want to sample from the feature space (i.e., use a subset of features), e.g., when the dimension of the feature space is large. If both the features and data points are randomly selected to create distinct training sets for individual models, then the method is called **random patches**. If only the features are sampled and all the data points are used for the individual models, then the method is called **random subspaces**. In addition, we noticed an obvious advantage of applying bagging (or pasting, random patches, random subspaces), which is training the individual learners can be easily parallelized.

    "A byproduct of bagging is that we have a measure to estimate how well the ensemble model performs for new data points, without actually having new data points or evaluating the ensemble model. The reason is that each individual model only sees part of the training data points, since the training set for each individual model is obtained from bootstrapping the entire training dataset. Hence, how the models perform on the data instances they did not see during the training process can be an estimator on how well the ensemble model generalizes. To be specific, a measure can be defined in this way: 1) for each data instance in the training set, we find all the models that did not use it during the training process; 2) evaluate these models at the data instance, and take the majority vote; 3) the majority vote is either equal to the true label or not; we compute the proportion of the data instances for which the true labels equal the majority votes. The proportion is defined as the **out-of-bag score** (**OOB score**). Mathematically, let $D_i$, $1\\le i\\le M$ be the set of data points used to train model $f_i$.

The motivation behind RF is to create training datasets for individual trees that are less dependent on each other (a collection of decorrelated trees). To this end, more randomness is introduced in the sampling process. For each individual model, a bootstrapped sample is first randomly selected. In the following process that construct a decision tree, for each node, instead of looking at all the possible choices of feature for a split and all the split points, RF randomly selects a subset of $k$ features, where $k<d$, a split criterion is decided based on the subset of features.
