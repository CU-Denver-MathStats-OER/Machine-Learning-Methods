    "A **decision tree** is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used for both classification and regression tasks. It splits the data into subsets/branches recursively based on feature values. Each branch of the tree-like structure serves as a decision rule, and each ending point of the tree (called a **leaf**) leads to a prediction. Given a new data instance, one can start from the **root node** of the tree (that contains all the data points), follow the branches (decision rules), reach internal nodes (called **children**), and finally reach a leaf to make predictions or decisions. The following diagram shows a decision tree to decide weather and how to go for a walk."

    "To train a decision tree, the main goal is to decide which feature to choose at a node and at what value of the feature the node is divided. To this end, we need to define a measure that can be used to compare different choices and values of features for divisions. A *greedy optimization approach* is typically used, beginning with a single root node that represents the entire training dataset. The tree is then grown incrementally by adding nodes one at a time. At each step, there are a set of candidate features and their values in the input space for the split, and once they are chosen, a pair of leaf nodes will be added to the current tree corresponding to the split. Let $\\{(\\boldsymbol{x}_1, y_1), \\dots, (\\boldsymbol{x}_N, y_N)\\}$ be a training dataset, where $y_i\\in\\{1,2,\\dots, K\\}$, $1\\le i\\le N$. Assume at a certain step, there has been a collection of leaf nodes $L=\\{L_1, L_2,\\dots, L_M\\}$, For each of the leaf nodes $L_i$, and a candidate criterion for the split, $c$, there will be two children for $L_i$, denoted by $L_i^0(c)$ and $L_i^1(c)$. To quantify the performance of the split, there are two commonly used measures, namely, **information gain** and **Gini index** (also known as **Gini impurity**). To define information gain, we first define the **information entropy** (or just **entropy**) as \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\Eta(L_i) = -\\sum_{k=1}^Kp_k\\log{p_k}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "where $p_k, k=1,\\dots,K$ is the proportion of data points in $L_i$ that belong to class $k$, and $\\log$ is the natural logarithm (base 2 is also commonly used). For each of the two children of $L_i$, we can compute $\\Eta(L_i^0(c))$ and $\\Eta(L_i^1(c))$ in the same way. The information gain can then be defined as the difference between the entropy of $L_i$ and the weighted some of the entropies of its two children:\n",

    "\\begin{equation*}\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $|\\cdot|$ denotes the number of data points associated with a node. Hence the weights are simply the proportion of data points in the children to the total number of instances in the parent. The larger the information gain, the purer the two children resulting from a split. Notice that if a split results in two pure children, then both children nodes have an entropy of $0$. If a node has the same proportion of each class (i.e., $p_k=\\frac{1}{K}$, $1\\le k\\le K$), then its entropy achieves a maximum (see Exercise 6-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to measure a potential split criterion $c$ is to evaluate the Gini index, which is defined as\n",
    "\n",

    "G(L_i) = \\sum_{k=0}^Kp_k(1-p_k) = 1-\\sum_{k=0}^Kp_k^2\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "$G(L_i)$ will be equal to $0$ if $L_i$ is pure, and it is largest when each class has the same proportion of the data instances (see Exercise 6-2). To evaluate the performance of the split criterion $c$, we calculate the weighted Gini index for the two children nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "G(L_i, c) = \\sum_{k=0}^1\\frac{|L_i^k(c)|}{|L_i|}G(L_i^k(c))\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "and we pick the best split that leads to the smallest $G(L_i, c)$. The process continues until certain stopping criterion is satisfied, for example, all leaf nodes are pure, or the depth of the tree (number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node) reaches a preset value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the algorithm works for both discrete and continuous features. For the latter, a discretization of the feature space needs to be performed before applying the algorithm."

For a node $L_i$ and a candidate criterion for the split, $c$, the resulting two children nodes are $L_i^0(c)$ and $L_i^1(c)$. Predictions of the target corresponding to a children node should be made by taking the average of all the $y_i$'s of those data points located in the node, which is equivalent to minimizing the sum-of-squares error in the node (see Excercise 6-3). Then, the optimal choice of $c$ will be the one that leads to the smallest residual sum-of-squares error.\n",

    "To avoid overfitting and increase generalization of decision trees, in the training process, it is a common practice to build a deep tree (e.g., to its maximum depth), and then trim the branches that contribute the least to the model's predictive power. One commonly used method is the **weakest link tree pruning** method (also known as **cost complexity pruning**) Assume a large tree has been built. To apply weakest link tree pruning, we evaluate each subtree in the decision tree for its contribution to the tree's performance, for example, using the misclassification rate for classification trees or residual sum-of-squares for regressin trees. Once we identify the \"weakest link\", i.e., the subtree, if removed, that leads to the smallest increase in the error (misclassification rate or residual sum-of-squares), the weakest link is pruned (removed) from the tree. The process is repeated iteratively until a stopping criterion is satisfied, e.g. the smallest increase in error by removing a weakest link is bigger than a threshold."
